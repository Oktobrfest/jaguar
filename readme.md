# Jaguar
Experimental AI Langchain platform to do OCR, chain-link, and save AI API prompts &amp; responses. Uses React &amp; Flask Backend.

This is undergoing a major re-write now that the proof of concept has been shown to work and is completed. So it's a work in progress at the present moment.

# Features
- SQLAlchemy DB integration will save your prompts and replies and track your chained prompts
- Perform local and remote OCR
- Multi-user
- Chat session capability
- Multi-Modal API Requests possible
- Uses multiple AI API Providers and can incorporate more. Currently ChatGPT/OpenAI & Googles Gemini. Perplexity planned.
- Video streaming
- Containerized using Docker via docker-compose
- Planned integration with my other project DoSomeReps.

  Would love some help in completing this sooner if anyone is interested! daveemail1@protonmail.com
